        <p>META is Monaco's 1st concept gallery. A young brand headed by three Malibu, CA raised siblings. Kira, Marina
            and Roy define the company's very exclusive bohemian style in art, jewelry and design.</p>
        <p>META is based in Monaco and also in New York City, where the brand introduces its new jewelry collections.</p>
        <p>META's original creations share distinct casual attributes that make them genuinely cosmopolitan. The
            collectible pieces are always locally handmade by the finest if not most avant garde craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>In ancient Greek 'meta' means beyond. In essence the concept tends towards sensorial elevation. The flagship
            gallery by the beach in Monte-Carlo fuses art, jewelry and design with technology.</p>
        <p>META regularly hosts events in Monaco and in New York, so stay tuned!</p>
