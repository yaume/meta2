<p>To be and know your Self is ultimate experience, absolute enjoyment. It is source of balance and measure between the inner and the outer.
<br>Our teaching is rooted in the most ancient techniques: Archaic-, Tibetan-, Tantric-Buddhism, Taoism, Zen-like. Sessions guide focus on your Self, with your Self and through your Self. </p>
<p>Very contemporary and easily accessible through inclusion of custom-made video and audio art.
<br>By meditating reduce mental and emotional agitation.
<br>Capture magic of being in the fleeting moment concentrating spiritually whilst breathing consciously.
